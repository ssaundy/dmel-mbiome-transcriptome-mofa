Partitioning Mitonuclear Contributions to Host-Microbiome Interactions: A Multi-Omics Analysis...

Abstract

The gut microbiome has emerged as an understudied contributor to missing heritability in complex traits, yet the relative contributions of nuclear DNA (nDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to microbiome composition and host gene expression remain poorly understood. Additionally, whether microbiome-transcriptome covariation generates phenotypic variation beyond host genetics alone has not yet been studied. In this project we sought to determine how mitonuclear genotype influences gut microbiome composition and host transcriptome profiles, and to identify novel axes of microbiome-transcriptome covariation. This was accomplished using Drosophila melanogaster mitonuclear introgression lines representing all combinations of two mtDNA and two nDNA backgrounds across 12 populations. 16S rRNA sequencing characterized gut microbiome composition, while RNA-seq captured host gut transcriptome variation. Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA2) integrated both datasets. Our analysis shows that, in this data, mtDNA variation was a strong driver of microbiome composition, explaining 7.0% of community variance with no significant nDNA effects. Conversely, nDNA variation dominated transcriptome patterns, accounting for 10.1% of gene expression variance compared to mtDNA's 1.4% contribution. Importantly, no significant mitonuclear interactions were detected. Integration helped identify one genotype-driven factor capturing variance in gene expression and two genotype-independent factors representing microbiome-transcriptome covariation. This method underscores the utility of multi-omics integration tools in uncovering additional layers of biological complexity missed by traditional methods.
